        Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for
        development operations like debugging, task running, and version
        control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick
        code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller
        featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE. Set up Visual Studio Code
        Download and install VS Code. Create a new file. See an overview of the
        user interface. Install support for your favorite programming language.
        Change your keyboard shortcuts and easily migrate from other editors
        using keymap extensions. Customize your editor with themes.
